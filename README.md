# Stock Trend Analysis & Portfolio Risk Assessment 📊

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on major tech stocks (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN) to understand price trends, volatility, and correlation over the past year.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**: Core language
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation
* **Yfinance**: Data scraping from Yahoo Finance
* **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Data visualization

## Key Analysis Steps
1.  **Data Extraction**: Automated fetching of historical stock data.
2.  **Trend Analysis**: Visualized closing prices to identify bullish/bearish trends.
3.  **Risk Analysis**: Calculated Daily Returns and plotted distributions to assess volatility.
4.  **Correlation Matrix**: Generated a heatmap to see how closely tech stocks are correlated.
5.Predictive Modeling: Implemented a Linear Regression algorithm using scikit-learn to forecast future stock prices with an accuracy score visualization.

## Key Insights
* **Volatility**: [Write which stock had the widest curve in the histogram here, e.g., "Amazon showed the highest volatility..."]
* **Correlation**: [Write your finding, e.g., "Google and Microsoft showed a high correlation of 0.85, indicating they move similarly."]
